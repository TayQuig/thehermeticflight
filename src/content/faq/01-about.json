        "q": "What makes The Hermetic Flight Aerial Tarot Deck different from other tarot decks?",
        "a": "<p>The Hermetic Flight combines the transformative art of aerial performance with traditional tarot symbolism in a way no deck has done before. Each card features real aerial artists captured in movement, creating a living embodiment of tarot archetypes. Unlike generic photographic decks, our imagery is intentionally choreographed to reflect traditional Rider-Waite-Smith symbolism while introducing fresh visual metaphors through bodies suspended in air—representing the liminal space where divination happens.</p><p>Key differentiators include 21 professional aerial performers and 100% human-created photography. All cards feature real humans, photographed and edited by David Horvitz.</p>"
