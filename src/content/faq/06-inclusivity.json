Tarot speaks to all humans; the imagery should reflect that.</p>"

        "q": "Did you rename any Major Arcana cards?",
        "a": "<p>No. All Major Arcana retain their traditional names (The Fool, The Magician, The High Priestess, etc.). We believe radical renaming creates unnecessary confusion and can indicate an oracle deck rather than a true tarot deck.</p><p>However, our interpretations honor both traditional and modern understandings—for example, The Devil addresses both shadow work and systemic oppression, and Death explores transformation beyond the individual level.</p>"
