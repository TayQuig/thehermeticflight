        "q": "Do I need to know anything about aerial arts to use this deck?",
        "a": "<p>Not at all. The deck is designed for tarot readers, not aerial performers. The guidebook explains any aerial-specific concepts needed to understand the imagery, but no prior knowledge is required.</p><p>The aerial elements serve as visual metaphors that enhance tarot meanings—suspension represents liminal space, inversions show perspective shifts, and apparatus choices reflect elemental qualities. These connections are intuitive even without aerial experience.</p>"

      {
        "q": "Why combine aerial arts with tarot divination?",
        "a": "<p>Aerial arts and tarot share profound symbolic resonance:</p><ul><li>Suspension = Liminal Space - Both practices exist between earth and sky, between the conscious and unconscious, between question and answer.</li><li>Defying Gravity = Transcendence - Aerial performance literally transcends normal physical limitations, just as divination transcends ordinary perception.</li><li>Trust and Release = Surrender - Both require releasing control to discover what's possible.</li><li>Physical Embodiment = Grounding Abstract Concepts - Aerial artists physically embody archetypes, making abstract tarot concepts viscerally tangible.</li><li>Risk and Transformation - Both practices involve calculated risk in service of transformation.</li></ul><p>The combination creates a uniquely powerful visual language for tarot divination.</p>"

      {
        "q": "Are all 78 cards photographed with aerial performers?",
        "a": "<p>The 78-card deck features 21 professional aerial artists across multiple cards. Not every single card shows aerial performance—some cards require grounded or environmental imagery—but the aerial aesthetic and symbolism thread throughout the entire deck, creating visual cohesion.</p>"
