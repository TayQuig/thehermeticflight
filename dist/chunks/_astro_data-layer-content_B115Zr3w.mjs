An introduction to The Hermetic Flight Aerial Tarot Deck and the philosophy behind combining aerial performance with divination practice.",["Date","2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z"],[18,19,20,21,22],"announcement","tarot","aerial arts","tarot divination","deck launch","The Hermetic Flight Team",false,"Between earth and sky, in that suspended moment where gravity releases its hold and possibility expands, we find ourselves in the same liminal space that tarot divination has always occupied—the threshold between question and answer, between the mundane and the mystical, between who we are and who we're becoming.\n\nThis is where **The Hermetic Flight** was born.\n\nAfter years of development, collaboration with 21 professional aerial performers, and countless hours of intentional choreography, we're approaching the launch of something unprecedented in the tarot community: a fully realized 78-card deck where every image captures real humans defying gravity to embody archetypal energy.\n\nBut this isn't just another photographic tarot deck. This is a response to something deeper—a recognition that the transformative journey of the aerial artist *is* the archetypal journey of tarot divination itself.\n\n## Why Aerial Arts and Tarot Belong Together\n\nIf you've ever watched an aerial performer suspended twenty feet in the air, trusting nothing but fabric, apparatus, and years of training to hold them aloft, you've witnessed something profound: the physical manifestation of surrender, trust, and transformation that every tarot reading asks of us.\n\n**Aerial arts and tarot divination share the same fundamental truth: growth happens in the space between.**\n\nBetween inhale and exhale. Between earth and sky. Between the card you hoped to pull and the card that actually appeared. Between the person you were when you asked the question and the person you'll become after integrating the answer.\n\nTraditional tarot decks—beautiful as they are—show us snapshots. A figure standing with a wand. A person sitting beneath swords. These images capture moments, but aerial performance captures *movement*. And movement is where transformation actually happens.\n\nWhen you see The High Priestess suspended in an aerial pose, you're not just seeing a static representation of intuitive wisdom—you're witnessing the active practice of trust that accessing intuition requires. When The Hanged Man inverts in silks, you're not just understanding perspective shift intellectually—you're seeing a body literally reorient its relationship to gravity and earth.\n\nThis is embodied divination. This is tarot that moves.\n\n## The Problem We're Solving\n\nHere's something most tarot creators don't talk about: **learning tarot is unnecessarily hard**.\n\nNot because the archetypes are complex—humans have been navigating these universal patterns since we first told stories around fires. Tarot is hard because we've created systems that prioritize memorization over intuition, rules over resonance, and \"correct\" interpretations over personal truth.\n\nThe feedback from the tarot community is consistent and loud:\n\n- \"I can't memorize 78 cards—it's overwhelming and I keep giving up\"\n- \"Court cards make no sense to me even after years of study\"\n- \"Every teacher contradicts the last one about reversals/spreads/meanings\"\n- \"The guidebook that came with my deck is useless—just generic keywords\"\n- \"I can't read for myself without my emotions clouding everything\"\n- \"How do I know if I'm 'doing it right' when there are so many different approaches?\"\n\nWe've heard these frustrations echoed across thousands of Reddit discussions, tarot forums, and student testimonials. The Hermetic Flight was designed with these specific challenges in mind.\n\n### Visual Storytelling Replaces Memorization\n\nWhen you see an aerial performer embodying the Nine of Swords—suspended in a tangle of fabric with their body reflecting the anxious, racing-mind energy of worry—you don't need to memorize \"anxiety, nightmares, mental anguish.\" You *see* it. You *feel* it. The image sticks because it's visceral.\n\nThis is how humans actually learn: through story, through body, through image. Not through flash cards and keyword lists.\n\n### Court Cards with Unmistakable Presence\n\nThe 16 court cards (Pages, Knights, Queens, Kings) are universally acknowledged as the hardest cards to interpret. Why? Because most decks show similar-looking figures with crowns and swords, leaving readers to puzzle out subtle differences in posture or props.\n\nIn aerial tarot, the difference between a Page and a Queen isn't subtle—it's physical. Page energy explores close to the ground, tentative, curious, learning. Queen energy commands space from height, embodied authority, mastery that doesn't need to prove itself. You see the difference in how they hold themselves suspended.\n\nThese aren't abstract concepts anymore. They're bodies you can read.\n\n### RWS Compatibility Meets Fresh Perspective\n\nWe haven't reinvented the wheel or renamed the Major Arcana (looking at you, decks that call Death \"Transformation\" and The Tower \"Disruption\"). The Hermetic Flight honors Rider-Waite-Smith symbolism—the foundation that 90% of tarot resources reference—while adding layers of meaning through aerial arts metaphor.\n\nIf you're already familiar with traditional tarot, you'll recognize the archetypal structures immediately. If you're brand new, you can use any RWS-based resource to supplement your learning. We're building on tradition, not abandoning it.\n\n## What Makes This Different From Other Decks\n\nThe tarot market is saturated. Beautiful decks launch on Kickstarter weekly. So why does The Hermetic Flight matter?\n\n### 1. Intentional Choreography, Not Posed Photography\n\nEvery card in this deck was choreographed specifically to embody its archetype. These aren't performers randomly arranged in pretty shapes—they're aerial artists who studied the card meanings, collaborated on movement choices, and physically embodied the energy we needed to capture.\n\nThe performer who became The Hermit spent time in that suspended solitude, finding the quality of intentional withdrawal and inner focus. The performer who became The Tower worked with us to capture that moment of necessary destruction, that precipice before the fall.\n\nThis is method acting applied to tarot. This is divination through deliberate embodiment.\n\n### 2. Real Bodies, Real Humans, Real Experience\n\nIn an era of AI-generated art flooding the tarot market, The Hermetic Flight is defiantly, proudly, entirely human-created. Every image features a real person—compensated fairly, credited in the guidebook, retaining rights to their images.\n\nThese are professional aerial artists from the Pacific Northwest community who brought their own experiences of transformation, fear, trust, and transcendence to these cards. You're not looking at digital approximations of human experience—you're looking at actual humans who know what it means to trust, to fall, to fly.\n\n### 3. Diversity That Reflects Reality\n\nAerial arts communities are genuinely diverse. People of all body types, ages, ethnicities, and backgrounds take to the air. The Hermetic Flight documents that reality.\n\nYou'll see performers in their 20s and performers in their 50s. You'll see different body types successfully executing advanced skills. You'll see diverse skin tones and gender presentations. This isn't tokenism—this is documentation of the actual community that made this deck possible.\n\nIf you've ever felt like tarot imagery didn't include someone who looks like you, we hope you'll find yourself reflected here.\n\n### 4. Premium Quality Built for Daily Use\n\nWe researched what the tarot community actually complains about regarding deck quality. The feedback was specific:\n\n- **Oversized cards hurt hands and are hard to shuffle** → We chose standard 2.75\" x 4.75\" sizing\n- **Thin, flimsy card stock feels cheap and doesn't last** → We're using 300-350 GSM premium stock\n- **Slick coating makes cards \"shoot off into space\" when shuffling** → Matte linen finish prevents this\n- **Guidebooks are generic and useless** → Comprehensive companion book with deck-specific meanings, performer stories, and original spreads\n- **Packaging falls apart immediately** → Rigid box with magnetic closure built to survive years of use\n\nThis deck is designed to be used, not just collected. We want you reading with it daily, not afraid to handle it.\n\n### 5. A Guidebook That Actually Guides\n\nOur companion guidebook goes far beyond standard \"Little White Books\":\n\n- **Deck-specific interpretations** explaining why we chose particular aerial poses and apparatus for each card\n- **Personal stories** from the creator and performers about their relationships with these archetypes\n- **Both upright and reversed meanings** (with permission to ignore reversals if that's not your style)\n- **Original spreads** designed specifically for the deck\n- **Structured learning path** for beginners that doesn't overwhelm\n- **Court card mastery section** with decision trees for determining interpretations\n- **Tips for reading objectively for yourself** addressing self-reading challenges\n- **Behind-the-scenes stories** from the photoshoots and choreography process\n\nThis is a teaching tool, not just a reference pamphlet.\n\n## Who This Deck Is For\n\n**You're a complete beginner** who's been intimidated by tarot's 78-card learning curve and wants a deck with imagery that speaks clearly without requiring memorization.\n\n**You're an experienced reader** looking for fresh perspective on cards you thought you knew completely, and you're drawn to the physicality of embodied archetypes.\n\n**You're an aerial artist or movement practitioner** who recognizes the spiritual dimensions of your practice and wants a divination tool that honors that connection.\n\n**You're tired of generic decks** that could be for anyone, and you want something with specific artistic vision and intentional creation behind every image.\n\n**You're building a professional tarot reading practice** and want a premium tool that justifies premium pricing while offering unique talking points with clients.\n\n**You're drawn to the combination** of ancient archetypal wisdom with contemporary performance art and you want to see what happens at that intersection.\n\n## What to Expect on This Blog\n\nAs we approach our **Kickstarter launch on January 11, 2026**, this blog will become your behind-the-scenes access to The Hermetic Flight's creation and philosophy.\n\n### Card Deep-Dives\n\nEach week, we'll feature a different card with:\n- The traditional RWS meaning and symbolism\n- How we interpreted it through aerial arts\n- The choreography choices and why we made them\n- Interview excerpts with the performer who embodied it\n- Photo gallery showing the progression from concept to final image\n- Tips for reading this card in different spread positions\n\n### Performer Stories\n\nThe 21 aerial artists who made this deck possible each have their own tarot journey. We'll be sharing:\n- What it felt like to physically embody Major Arcana energy\n- Their personal relationships with the cards they performed\n- How aerial arts practice has functioned as divination in their own lives\n- Technical challenges of executing poses while maintaining archetypal energy\n\n### Tarot Divination Techniques\n\nDrawing from years of teaching and reading experience, we'll offer:\n- Spreads designed specifically for this deck's strengths\n- Guidance on reading for yourself without losing objectivity\n- Court card interpretation frameworks\n- How to move beyond keyword memorization into intuitive reading\n- Addressing common beginner mistakes and frustrations\n\n### The Philosophy of Suspension\n\nExploring the deeper connections between aerial arts and tarot:\n- Liminal space and threshold consciousness\n- Trust and surrender in both practices\n- Transformation through calculated risk\n- The body as oracle\n- Defying gravity as spiritual practice\n\n### Kickstarter Updates\n\nAs we move toward and through the campaign:\n- Sneak peeks at packaging and stretch goals\n- Campaign preparation tips for those considering backing\n- Transparent updates on production timelines and shipping\n- Community building and connection opportunities\n\n## The Invitation\n\nTarot divination isn't fortune-telling. It's not about predicting a fixed future or receiving messages from external forces (though if that's your framework, there's room for you here too).\n\nAt its core, tarot is about **creating space for reflection**. It's about using archetypal imagery to unlock perspectives you already possess but haven't consciously accessed. It's about asking better questions and sitting with complex answers. It's about recognizing patterns and possibilities.\n\nAnd sometimes, it's about seeing a human body suspended in silk, trusting absolutely in their apparatus and training, and recognizing that same quality of trust being asked of you in your reading.\n\nThe Hermetic Flight exists because we believe tarot can be more accessible, more embodied, more visually compelling, and more intuitive than current options offer. We believe learning shouldn't require memorization. We believe imagery should tell clear stories. We believe quality matters. And we believe the intersection of aerial arts and tarot divination reveals something neither practice shows alone.\n\n**Between earth and sky, between question and answer, between who you are and who you're becoming—this is where we find our truth in suspension.**\n\nWelcome to The Hermetic Flight.

The back design reads identically from either direction, so you can't tell if a card is reversed before flipping it. This supports all reading styles, whether you use reversals or not.</p>",{q:59,a:60},"What kind of packaging does it come with?","<p>The deck includes a rigid box with magnetic closure—significantly more durable than standard paperboard packaging.

Each card features real aerial artists captured in movement, creating a living embodiment of tarot archetypes. Unlike generic photographic decks, our imagery is intentionally choreographed to reflect traditional Rider-Waite-Smith symbolism while introducing fresh visual metaphors through bodies suspended in air—representing the liminal space where divination happens.</p><p>Key differentiators include 21 professional aerial performers, 100% human-created photography, and fully illustrated Minor Arcana cards.</p>",{q:75,a:76},"Is this deck suitable for beginners?","<p>Absolutely. The Hermetic Flight was designed with beginners in mind while remaining valuable for experienced readers. The aerial imagery provides intuitive visual stories that help new readers understand card meanings without pure memorization.</p>",{q:78,a:79},"Will this deck work if I'm already familiar with Rider-Waite-Smith?","<p>Yes!

Where do I start?","<p>Start simple and build gradually:</p><ul><li>Begin with daily single-card pulls - Pull one card each morning and reflect on how its energy shows up in your day</li><li>Focus on the imagery first - What do you see? What emotions does it evoke? Trust your initial impressions</li><li>Then reference the guidebook - Compare your intuitive read with traditional meanings</li><li>Journal your interpretations - Track how your understanding evolves</li></ul><p>Don't try to memorize all 78 cards at once. Our guidebook includes a structured learning path that introduces cards in manageable groups, starting with the Major Arcana's 22 cards before moving to the suits.</p>",{q:91,a:92},"Do I need to be \"psychic\" or \"intuitive\" to read tarot?","<p>No. While some readers incorporate psychic abilities, tarot works equally well as a psychological tool, creative prompt, or decision-making framework. The cards create a structured space for reflection—the insight comes from your own wisdom, not supernatural ability.</p><p>Many successful tarot readers approach the practice completely secularly, using the archetypal imagery to unlock perspectives they already possess but haven't consciously accessed.</p>",{q:94,a:95},"How long does it take to learn tarot divination?","<p>You can give meaningful readings from day one, even if they're simple. Most people feel comfortable with:</p><ul><li>Single-card pulls: Immediately</li><li>Three-card spreads: Within 2-4 weeks</li><li>Complex spreads: 3-6 months</li><li>Reading professionally for others: 1-2 years of regular practice</li></ul><p>The Hermetic Flight's visual storytelling accelerates this timeline by making card meanings more immediately accessible than text-heavy or abstract decks.</p>",{q:97,a:98},"Should I learn reversed card meanings?","<p>That's completely up to you—there's no \"right\" answer. Some readers use reversals, others don't. Both approaches are valid.</p><p>Arguments against learning reversals initially:</p><ul><li>You're already learning 78 cards; don't double your workload unnecessarily</li><li>Many professional readers never use reversals and read beautifully</li><li>You can always add reversals later if desired</li></ul><p>Arguments for learning reversals:</p><ul><li>Adds nuance and depth to readings</li><li>Helps identify blocked or internalized energy</li><li>Some spreads benefit from directional indicators</li></ul><p>Our guidebook includes reversed meanings for those who want them, but frames them as optional rather than required.</p>",{q:100,a:101},"What's the deal with court cards? Everyone says they're confusing.","<p>Court cards (Pages, Knights, Queens, Kings) are notoriously tricky because they can represent:</p><ul><li>Actual people in your life</li><li>Aspects of your own personality</li><li>Situational approaches or energy</li><li>Messages or stages of development</li></ul><p>The Hermetic Flight addresses this confusion through distinct physical embodiment. Each court card features a performer whose presence, movement quality, and energy clearly conveys whether you're encountering:</p><ul><li>Page energy (curious, learning, grounded exploration)</li><li>Knight energy (dynamic action, forward momentum)</li><li>Queen energy (mastery, internal authority)</li><li>King energy (external authority, established power)</li></ul><p>The guidebook includes a dedicated court card section with specific guidance on determining which interpretation applies in context.</p>","src/content/faq/02-beginners.json","5829642244a87812","05-aerial",{id:104,data:106,filePath:118,digest:119},{title:107,questions:108},"Aerial Arts Integration",[109,112,115],{q:110,a:111},"Do I need to know anything about aerial arts to use this deck?","<p>Not at all. The deck is designed for tarot readers, not aerial performers. The guidebook explains any aerial-specific concepts needed to understand the imagery, but no prior knowledge is required.</p><p>The aerial elements serve as visual metaphors that enhance tarot meanings—suspension represents liminal space, inversions show perspective shifts, and apparatus choices reflect elemental qualities.

We believe radical renaming creates unnecessary confusion and can indicate an oracle deck rather than a true tarot deck.</p><p>However, our interpretations honor both traditional and modern understandings—for example, The Devil addresses both shadow work and systemic oppression, and Death explores transformation beyond the individual level.</p>","src/content/faq/06-inclusivity.json","2f188d39ab3f6e3a","09-post-kickstarter",{id:158,data:160,filePath:175,digest:176},{title:161,questions:162},"After the Kickstarter",[163,166,169,172],{q:164,a:165},"Will there be a companion app or digital version?","<p>Potentially in the future, but not as part of the initial Kickstarter. We're focused on delivering an exceptional physical deck first. If there's significant community interest in a digital companion (for journaling, learning, or virtual readings), we may explore that in a later phase.</p>",{q:167,a:168},"Are you planning expansion decks or oracle cards?","<p>We're open to community input! Possible future projects could include:</p><ul><li>Oracle deck exploring aerial arts more abstractly</li><li>Expanded guidebook with additional spreads and techniques</li><li>Educational content (courses, workshops, videos)</li><li>Collaboration decks featuring different aerial disciplines (pole, hoop, rope, etc.)</li></ul><p>For now, our energy is devoted to making The Hermetic Flight the best possible tarot deck it can be.</p>",{q:170,a:171},"How can I connect with other people using this deck?","<p>We're building community spaces where readers can:</p><ul><li>Share interpretations and insights</li><li>Post photos of their readings (with consent)</li><li>Ask questions and get support</li><li>Connect with other aerial artists and tarot readers</li><li>Access exclusive content and advanced techniques</li></ul><p>Details will be announced during the Kickstarter campaign.

The premium quality, clear imagery, and comprehensive guidebook make it excellent for:</p><ul><li>In-person readings</li><li>Video chat/online readings</li><li>Workshop teaching</li><li>Photography for your marketing materials (with credit)</li></ul><p>Professional readers backing at higher tiers will receive multiple decks at reduced pricing.</p>","src/content/faq/09-post-kickstarter.json","e4664654e3960d3c","07-technique",{id:177,data:179,filePath:194,digest:195},{title:180,questions:181},"Reading Practice & Technique",[182,185,188,191],{q:183,a:184},"Can I read tarot for myself, or do I need to see a professional reader?","<p>You can absolutely read for yourself! While reading for yourself presents objectivity challenges (emotional investment in outcomes can cloud interpretation), millions of people maintain successful self-reading practices.</p><p>Our guidebook includes specific techniques for reading objectively for yourself:</p><ul><li>Using clarifier cards when confused</li><li>Journaling before and after readings</li><li>Setting clear intentions before shuffling</li><li>Waiting 24-48 hours before rereading on emotional topics</li><li>Treating yourself like a client you're reading for</li></ul><p>Self-reading is also more affordable, private, and convenient than regular professional sessions.</p>",{q:186,a:187},"How do I know if my tarot reading is accurate?","<p>Tarot isn't fortune-telling—it's reflection, pattern recognition, and intuitive synthesis. \"Accuracy\" isn't about prediction but about resonance:</p><p>A valuable reading:</p><ul><li>Provides new perspective on your situation</li><li>Resonates emotionally even if intellectually challenging</li><li>Offers actionable insight</li><li>Creates clarity where there was confusion</li><li>Feels neither overly vague nor impossibly specific</li></ul><p>A less useful reading:</p><ul><li>Feels completely disconnected from your situation</li><li>Uses only generic statements that could apply to anyone</li><li>Leaves you more confused than when you started</li><li>Makes you feel anxious without offering constructive guidance</li></ul><p>The cards reveal patterns and possibilities, not fixed futures. Your free will always determines outcomes.</p>",{q:189,a:190},"What if I pull \"scary\" cards like Death, The Tower, or The Devil?","<p>These cards have unfairly frightening reputations! Understanding their actual meanings eliminates the fear:</p><ul><li>Death - Transformation, endings that make space for beginnings, shedding what no longer serves you. Rarely literal death.</li><li>The Tower - Sudden revelation, necessary destruction of false structures, breakthrough after breakdown. Liberation disguised as disaster.</li><li>The Devil - Recognizing bondage (to addiction, toxic patterns, limiting beliefs), shadow work, reclaiming power from what controls you.</li></ul><p>These cards often appear during our most significant growth periods. Our guidebook includes detailed explorations of commonly feared cards, reframing them as powerful allies rather than omens.</p>",{q:192,a:193},"How often should I read my cards?","<p>There's no \"should\"—it's entirely personal. Common practices include:</p><ul><li>Daily single-card meditation</li><li>Weekly deeper spreads</li><li>Monthly overview readings</li><li>As-needed guidance on specific questions</li></ul><p>Warning signs you're overreading:</p><ul><li>Pulling cards repeatedly on the same question seeking different answers</li><li>Feeling anxious when you can't read daily</li><li>Making no decisions without consulting cards first</li><li>Reading becomes compulsive rather than reflective</li></ul><p>If you notice dependency developing, consider taking a break and consulting a therapist or trusted friend about decision-making patterns.</p>","src/content/faq/07-technique.json","c9ac899c85bb8e65","10-about-creator",{id:196,data:198,filePath:210,digest:211},{title:199,questions:200},"About the Creator",[201,204,207],{q:202,a:203},"Who created The Hermetic Flight?","<p>The Hermetic Flight is created by Deirdre Quigley, an aerial arts instructor and Reiki practitioner who recognized the profound symbolic resonance between aerial performance and tarot divination.
